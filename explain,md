Certainly! If you're creating a video where you're explaining how each part of the script works with data manipulation, including a math-based example, here's how you can break down each section with **simple mathematical examples** to make it clear and engaging for your audience.

### **1. Introduce the Dataset**:

Before diving into the functions, it's helpful to briefly introduce the dataset:

```python
data = {
    'id': [1, 2, None, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, None],
    'score': [10, 20, 30, None, None, 70, 80, None, None, None],
    'name': ['a', 'b', None, None, None, None, 'h', 'i', 'j', None]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

You can explain:

"This is a sample dataset with columns `id`, `score`, and `name`. Some of the values are missing, which we refer to as `null` values. We will focus on how to handle those missing values in different ways."

---

### **2. Identify Null Values**:

The first step is identifying where the missing values are in your dataset.

```python
print(df.isnull())
```

**Math Example**:  
Let's say the dataset looks like this:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | 20    | b    |
| None| 30    | None |
| 4   | None  | None |
| 5   | None  | None |
| 6   | 70    | None |
| 7   | 80    | h    |
| 8   | None  | i    |
| 9   | None  | j    |
| None| None  | None |

The **`isnull()`** function will return a table of `True` or `False`, where `True` indicates a missing value:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| False | False | False |
| False | False | False |
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | False | True  |
| False | False | False |
| False | True  | False |
| False | True  | False |
| True  | True  | True  |

You can then explain:
- **True** means the value is missing (`NaN`).
- **False** means the value is present.

---

### **3. Fill Missing Data with Mean**:

Next, we can fill the missing values with the **mean** of the column. This is one way to handle missing values by filling them with the average of the existing values.

```python
df['score'] = df['score'].fillna(df['score'].mean())
```

**Math Example**:
- The **mean** of `score` excluding `None` values is calculated like this:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{10 + 20 + 30 + 70 + 80}{5} = \frac{210}{5} = 42
  \]
- Any missing `score` values (i.e., `None`) will be replaced with `42`.

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | 20    | b    |
| None| 30    | c    |
| 4   | 42    | d    |
| 5   | 42    | e    |
| 6   | 70    | f    |
| 7   | 80    | h    |
| 8   | 42    | i    |
| 9   | 42    | j    |
| None| 42    | k    |

---

### **4. Fill Missing Data with Median**:

Similarly, we can replace missing values with the **median** value of the column.

```python
df['score'] = df['score'].fillna(df['score'].median())
```

**Math Example**:
The **median** is the middle value when the data is sorted. For example, if we have the sorted `score` values: `[10, 20, 30, 70, 80]`, the median would be `30` (the middle value).

If there are missing values, they will be replaced with `30` (the median).

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | 20    | b    |
| None| 30    | c    |
| 4   | 30    | d    |
| 5   | 30    | e    |
| 6   | 70    | f    |
| 7   | 80    | h    |
| 8   | 30    | i    |
| 9   | 30    | j    |
| None| 30    | k    |

---

### **5. Forward Fill Missing Data**:

Forward filling uses the previous available value to fill the missing one. 

```python
df_filled_ffill = df.fillna(method='ffill')
```

**Math Example**:
If the `score` column looks like this:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | None  | b    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |
| 4   | None  | d    |

After forward fill, the missing values will be filled with the last available value:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | 10    | b    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |
| 4   | 30    | d    |

---

### **6. Backward Fill Missing Data**:

Backward fill is similar to forward fill, but it uses the next available value to fill the missing one.

```python
df_filled_bfill = df.fillna(method='bfill')
```

**Math Example**:
If the `score` column looks like this:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | None  | b    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |
| 4   | None  | d    |

After backward fill, the missing values will be filled with the next available value:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | 30    | b    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |
| 4   | 30    | d    |

---

### **7. Drop Columns with More Than 49% Missing Data**:

You can drop columns that have a high percentage of missing data (e.g., greater than 49%).

```python
def percent_missing(col):
    missing_percentage = (col.isnull().sum() / len(col)) * 100
    if missing_percentage >= 49:
        return True
    return False

columns_to_drop = [col for col in df.columns if percent_missing(df[col])]
df_cleaned = df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)
```

**Math Example**:
For a column like `score`, if it has more than 49% missing data, it will be dropped. Let's say we have 10 rows, and 6 are missing in the `score` column, which is 60%. This column would be dropped.

---

### **8. Drop Rows with Missing Data**:

Sometimes, you may want to simply **drop rows** that contain missing data.

```python
df_dropped_rows = df.dropna(axis=0)  # Drop rows with missing values
```

**Math Example**:
If the `score` column looks like this:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 2   | None  | b    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |

After dropping rows with missing data, only rows with complete data remain:

| id  | score | name |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1   | 10    | a    |
| 3   | 30    | c    |

---

### **Final Thoughts for the Video**:
- Throughout the video, you can explain how different techniques for handling missing data are chosen based on the context of the dataset and the type of analysis.
- You can also mention that there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for missing data. The method chosen depends on the business or analysis requirements.

This structure should help you explain each part of the script clearly with both examples and mathematical explanations! Let me know if you'd like to adjust or add anything further.
